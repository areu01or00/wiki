# Wiki Explorer — Run Log

## 2026-06-25 16:14 UTC — Emergent-concept search (3 fresh themes)

**Mode**: emergent-concept-search (all 9 named chains at 4/4 since 2026-05-25)
**Method**: web_search title-quoted topic queries (LLM reasoning / MoE / long-context / agents) + arxiv abs-page meta extraction via curl
**Candidates surveyed**: 12 fresh June-2026 arxiv IDs (all cs.CL / cs.AI / cs.IR, all deduped clean against existing entities)
**Papers added**: 3

### Papers
1. **Self-Compacting Language Model Agents** (2606.23525) — Li, Zhang, Jurayj (cs.CL, 2026-06-22). Theme: LLM agents / context-management / inference-efficiency. Introduces inference-time self-compaction; quantifies trace-anchoring degradation; Accordion-thinking primitive.
2. **The Periodic Table of LLM Reasoning: A Structured Survey** (2606.11470) — Anand, Ramesh, Mittal (cs.CL, 2026-06-09). Theme: LLM reasoning / survey / taxonomy. 3-axis taxonomy of ~120 methods (2022-2026); empty-cell research-frontier map.
3. **Agents' Last Exam** (2606.05405) — Sun, Han, Zhang (cs.AI, 2026-06-03). Theme: LLM agents / benchmarking / evaluation. 1,000+ expert-authored tasks across 52 professional subdomains; rubric-based grading harness.

### Parent updates
- `entities/emergent-concepts.md` ## Updates — MERGE-then-SORT prepend (existing top entries 06-24, 06-23, 06-23; new entries interleaved below: 06-22, 06-09, 06-03).

### Coordination note (pitfall 50)
A parallel wiki-explore-agent run fired at 16:15 UTC during this session and committed 6 entity files (the 3 new + 3 from a prior session already in HEAD). This run brought the state files (`explore_context.json`, `watch_profiles.json`) in sync with the entity files that were already in HEAD, completing the bookkeeping for the 3 papers (2606.23525, 2606.11470, 2606.05405) that were added as entity files by the parallel run but not yet reflected in the state-file mirror lists.

### Dedup
- `endswith(f'-{arxiv_id}.md')` suffix check: 0 collisions (12 of 12 candidates were fresh)
- `watch_profiles.json[last_result_hashes]`: 3 new MD5 hashes appended (top-level only — `llm-wiki` and `profiles.llm-wiki-explore` sub-profiles do not exist in this restored wiki's watch_profiles.json)
- `explore_context.json[chains][*][papers_found]`: 3 new entries appended to `emergent-concepts` chain
